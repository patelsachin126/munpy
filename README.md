Histology is an important tool for cancer cell analysis. This software not only has the potential to detect cancer cells generally, but also to classify subtypes of cancer and therefore the progression for prognotstic purposes. Common cancers such as bowel cancer require TNM staging to define their charactersitics. This early intervention would in turn help deliver more targeted treatments options sooner.

The application of this software in cancer cell detection is a demonstration of its use case in other parts of medicine such as acute settings. Nearly all CT scan results are filed with detailed radiological reports with a summary of important positive and negative findings. This however is not the case in bedside ED diagnostics such as X-rays where reporting turnover is limited.

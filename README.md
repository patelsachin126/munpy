Histology is an important tool for cancer cell analysis. This software not only has the potential to detect cancer cells generally, but also to classify subtypes of cancer and therefore the progression for prognotstic purposes. This early intervention would in turn help deliver more targeted treatments options sooner.

The application of this software in cancer cell detection is a demonstration of its use case in other parts of medicine such as acute settings. Nearl all CT scan results are filed with detailed radiological reports with a summary of important positives and negatives. This however is not the case in bedside ED diagnostics such as X-rays where reporting turnover is limited.
